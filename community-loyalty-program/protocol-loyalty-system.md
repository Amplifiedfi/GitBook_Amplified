# Protocol Loyalty System

The Amplified Protocol implements a sophisticated point system designed to reward both ETH deposits and community building. This dual-incentive structure creates a sustainable ecosystem that benefits both individual participants and the broader network.

### Getting Started

The Amplified Protocol implements a sophisticated point system designed to reward both ETH deposits and community building. This dual-incentive structure creates a sustainable ecosystem that benefits both individual participants and the broader network.

### **How Community Rewards Are Calculated**

The foundation of the point system is a precise 1:1 relationship between ETH deposited and base points earned:

### **Direct Deposit Base Points**

| **ETH Deposited** | **Base Points Earned** | **Precision Example**            | **Description**                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0.00001 ETH       | 0.00001 points         | Micro deposits are supported     | Points scale proportionally to deposit size |
| 0.1 ETH           | 0.1 points             | Fractional deposits are rewarded | Smooth scaling for smaller deposits         |
| 0.5 ETH           | 0.5 points             | Half the standard unit           | Intermediate deposit example                |
| **1 ETH**         | **1 point**            | **Standard reference unit**      | Foundation for linear scaling               |
| 10 ETH            | 10 points              | Proportional increase            | Larger deposits yield higher points         |
| ∞ ETH             | ∞ points               | Scaling continues indefinitely   | No cap on earning potential                 |

### **Point Multiplication Tiers**

Your total deposit determines your earning tier, with multipliers applied hourly:

#### **Deposit Range, Hourly Multiplier, and Earning Rates**

| **Deposit Range** | **Hourly Multiplier** | **Effective Earning Rate** | **Strategic Significance** |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0 - 1 ETH         | 1x                    | 1 point per ETH/hour       | Entry-level tier           |
| >1 - 10 ETH       | 2x                    | 2 points per ETH/hour      | Intermediate tier          |
| >10 - 100 ETH     | 4x                    | 4 points per ETH/hour      | Advanced tier              |
| >100 - 500 ETH    | 8x                    | 8 points per ETH/hour      | Professional tier          |
| >500 ETH          | 16x                   | 16 points per ETH/hour     | Institutional tier         |

### **Detailed Point Accumulation Mechanics**

#### **How Points Are Earned**

#### Continuous Accumulation

* Points accrue every hour based on your deposit
* No minimum duration requirement
* Earnings continue as long as ETH remains deposited

#### Tier Benefits

* Higher tiers offer exponentially better earning rates
* Each ETH in your deposit earns at your tier's multiplier rate
* Tiers are calculated based on total wallet deposits
