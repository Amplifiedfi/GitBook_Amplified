# How the Amplified Point System Works

The Amplified Community Loyalty Program is designed to recognize and reward our most loyal and active community members. By participating in our ecosystem and helping Amplified grow, you contribute to a stronger, more resilient protocol—and we want to thank you for it. Through this program, members are acknowledged for their loyalty, engagement, and contributions that bring value to Amplified.

### Amplified's Point System Explained

The Amplified point system is designed to reward users fairly and incentivize larger deposits through **linear scaling** and **multipliers**. Here’s how it works:

***

### **1. Linear Scaling for Points**

* **Points are earned based on the exact amount of ETH deposited**. For example:
  * Depositing **0.00001 ETH** earns **0.00001 points**.
  * Depositing **0.1 ETH** earns **0.1 points**.
  * Depositing **1 ETH** earns **1 point**.
  * Depositing **10 ETH** earns **10 points**.
* **Scaling continues indefinitely**, meaning there’s no maximum limit to the points you can earn as you deposit more ETH.

***

### **2. 1 ETH as the Standard Unit**

* **1 ETH = 1 point** serves as the baseline for the system.
* All deposits scale proportionally up or down:
  * **0.5 ETH** earns **0.5 points**.
  * **5 ETH** earns **5 points**.
  * This ensures fairness for deposits of any size, whether small or large.

***

### **3. Multipliers to Earn Points Faster**

* Larger deposits unlock **higher multipliers** that increase the rate at which you earn points per hour.
* **Deposit Range and Hourly Multiplier**:
  * **0–1 ETH**: Earn **1 point per ETH/hour**.
  * **>1–10 ETH**: Earn **2 points per ETH/hour**.
  * **>10–100 ETH**: Earn **4 points per ETH/hour**.
  * **>100–500 ETH**: Earn **8 points per ETH/hour**.
  * **>500 ETH**: Earn **16 points per ETH/hour**.
* **Example**:
  * A deposit of **2 ETH** earns 2 points/hour with a 2x multiplier.
  * A deposit of **50 ETH** earns 200 points/hour with a 4x multiplier.
  * A deposit of **1,000 ETH** earns 16,000 points/hour with a 16x multiplier.

***

### **4. Referral System to Build Even More Points**

* **Earn points by referring others to deposit ETH**, with a **two-level referral system**:
  1. **Direct Referrals (Level 1):**
     * Earn **20% of the points** accumulated by users you directly refer.
  2. **Indirect Referrals (Level 2):**
     * Earn **10% of the points** from users referred by your direct referrals.
* **Example**:
  * **You Deposit:** 5 ETH (earning 2 points/hour with a multiplier).
  * **Direct Referral:** Refers Alice (deposits 10 ETH, earning 4 points/hour).
    * **You Earn:** 0.8 points/hour (20% of Alice’s points).
  * **Indirect Referral:** Alice refers Bob (deposits 1 ETH, earning 1 point/hour).
    * **You Earn:** 0.1 points/hour (10% of Bob’s points).

## Compounding Point Systems

1. **More ETH, Faster Growth**:
   * Larger deposits not only generate more points outright but also benefit from higher multipliers, **accelerating point accumulation over time**.
2. **Unlimited Potential**:
   * The system has no cap, meaning the more ETH you deposit, the more points you can earn, both from the linear scaling and from the increasing multiplier tiers.
3. **Referral Rewards**:
   * Referring others amplifies your earning potential, creating an additional passive income stream for points beyond your own deposits.
