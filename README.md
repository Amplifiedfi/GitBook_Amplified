# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Amplified Protocol

### Liquidity & Yield Layer of the LSD Capital Markets

Amplified Protocol serves as a Liquidity & Yield Layer for Liquid Staking Derivatives (LST/LRT), delivering institutional-grade vault management for both retail and professional DeFi capital allocators. \
\
The protocol enables on-chain structured products that optimize liquidity and yield generation through seamless integration with leading LST/LRT providers.

We transform complex DeFi operations into a single, sophisticated investment vehicle through our four-layer architecture:

* **User Layer** simplifies access through a single token, aaaETH LRT.
* **Execution Layer** manages risk, monitors performance and optimizes portfolio allocations.
* **Strategy Layer** deploys capital across optimized yield strategies enabling advanced ALM, lending, derivatives, and leverage components.
* **Market Layer** interfaces directly with LST, LRT, and DeFi protocols.

Amplified not only simplifies the user experience but also unlocks billions in liquidity, enhances network security, positioning the protocol as a key driver in the evolution of DeFi 2.0.
