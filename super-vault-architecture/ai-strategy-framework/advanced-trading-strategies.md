# Advanced Trading Strategies

### Advanced Trading Strategies

Amplified's protocol architecture is designed with the capability to support advanced trading strategies, including leveraged trading and derivatives implementation. While these features are not initially activated, they represent future strategic opportunities that can be enabled through governance decisions.

**Future Capabilities:**

* Leverage optimization and position management
* Derivatives trading (options and futures)

These capabilities are built into Amplified's infrastructure but remain dormant until governance determines their implementation timing and parameters. This approach ensures that the protocol can evolve in response to market conditions and community needs while maintaining security and stability.

The modular design of Amplified allows for strategic expansion of these features through careful governance oversight, enabling the protocol to adapt and grow in alignment with market maturity and user demands.

Note: Implementation of these strategies will be subject to governance approval and thorough security considerations.
