### **Core Functions**

The aiETH token represents Amplified’s innovative approach to yield-bearing assets, offering multiple essential functions that benefit both the protocol and its users:

* **Value Representation**:This structure ensures that value generated within the protocol is transparently and fairly distributed among aiETH holders.
  * **Direct Ownership Share**: aiETH holders gain a proportional stake in the protocol’s LSD re-staking pools.
  * **Yield Entitlement**: Holders have a claim on the yields generated by the protocol’s staking and DeFi strategies.
  * **Participation Rights**: aiETH enables holders to engage in and benefit from protocol strategies.

### **Value Growth Mechanisms**

aiETH’s value is designed to appreciate through various channels, offering diversified yield sources and maximizing returns:

* **Staking Rewards**: Accumulation of validator rewards from the Ethereum network.
* **DeFi Strategy Earnings**: Gains from advanced DeFi strategies executed within the protocol.
* **Platform Fee Revenue**: A share of the protocol’s fee revenues is distributed to aiETH holders.
* **Re-Staking, Rebalancing, and Compounding**: Additional returns generated through strategic re-staking and automated compounding.

This multi-layered approach to value accrual supports aiETH’s growth potential while diversifying its yield sources, providing a sustainable and robust yield-bearing asset for holders.
