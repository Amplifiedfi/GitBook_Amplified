# Managing Protocol and Strategy Executors

The success of a yield-generating protocol heavily depends on the effective management of its strategy executors and integration points. This aspect of governance becomes particularly crucial in the LST/LRT ecosystem, where multiple yield sources and strategies must be carefully coordinated to maximize returns while managing risk.

Amplified's approach to managing protocol and strategy executors focuses on three key areas: careful selection and monitoring of external managers, maintaining reliable data feeds through robust oracle systems, and continuous risk assessment. This comprehensive management framework ensures that all protocol components work together effectively while maintaining security and performance.

### **External Strategy Managers**

The selection and oversight of external strategy managers are crucial governance responsibilities. These managers are responsible for executing yield-generating strategies and managing protocol assets. Amplified’s governance process emphasizes expertise, security, and innovation in selecting and monitoring these managers.

1. **Selection Process**:
   * **Proposal Requirements**:
     * Submission of detailed strategy documentation.
     * Comprehensive risk assessment for proposed strategies.
     * Verification of the manager’s track record and technical capabilities.
   * **Community Review**:
     * Open discussion period for community feedback.
     * Technical evaluation and risk analysis by governance participants.
     * Performance projections to assess potential impact on protocol yields.
2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   * **Regular Reporting**:
     * Managers are required to provide consistent performance reports.
     * Monitoring of yield metrics, risk exposure, and strategy compliance.
   * **Evaluation Metrics**:
     * Capital efficiency and adherence to agreed-upon yield strategies.
     * Periodic reviews to ensure that strategies align with protocol goals.

### **Oracles and On-Chain Relayers**

In decentralized finance, reliable data and transaction execution are foundational for protocol security. Amplified’s governance includes rigorous management of oracles and on-chain relayers to prevent data manipulation and ensure accurate execution. This system has multiple layers of protection to enhance data integrity and system resilience.

1. **Data Integrity**:
   * **Oracle Implementation**:
     * Aggregates data from multiple sources to minimize single-point failures.
     * Cross-validation and regular verification to detect anomalies.
     * Proactive failure detection to maintain data accuracy.
   * **Data Quality**:
     * Strict accuracy requirements with frequent updates.
     * Deviation thresholds and backup systems to protect against data errors.
2. **System Reliability**:
   * **Operational Standards**:
     * High uptime standards and continuous performance monitoring.
     * Redundancy systems to reduce downtime risk.
   * **Backup Mechanisms**:
     * Secondary data sources and fallback procedures to ensure continuity.
     * Emergency protocols and system restoration processes for resilience.

### **Risk Assessments**

Amplified’s governance includes a continuous risk assessment framework to adapt to the dynamic DeFi environment. This framework enables rapid response to evolving risks, ensuring the protocol maintains security and performance across all strategy execution layers.

1. **Continuous Evaluation**:
   * **Strategy Assessment**:
     * Regular reviews of strategy risks and performance metrics.
     * Adjustments based on market conditions to optimize yields.
   * **Counterparty Analysis**:
     * Evaluation of counterparties and integrated protocols.
     * Assessment of integration risks and dependency on external systems.
2. **Parameter Management**:
   * **Dynamic Risk Adjustments**:
     * Real-time updates to risk parameters based on market conditions.
     * Ongoing monitoring of risk metrics and threshold management.
   * **Strategy Modification**:
     * Changes based on performance, risk levels, and capital allocation.
     * Review of protocol integrations to ensure compatibility and security.
