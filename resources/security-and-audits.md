### **Professional Security Audits**

Amplified undergoes regular, independent security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Each audit provides a thorough examination of the protocol's smart contracts and infrastructure, enabling Amplified to implement any necessary security enhancements.

* **Pessimistic Audit Report**
* **Code4rena Audit Report**

These audits provide the community with transparency and confidence, demonstrating Amplified‚Äôs commitment to proactive security management.

### **Continuous Security Measures**

To protect against potential threats, Amplified implements ongoing security maintenance and monitoring, ensuring that protocol operations remain safe and secure.

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   * **Transaction Pattern Analysis**: Monitors transaction behaviors to detect irregular patterns.
   * **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual activity that could indicate security risks.
   * **Threshold Monitoring**: Tracks key metrics, such as risk parameters and performance levels.
   * **Risk Parameter Tracking**: Ensures risk levels remain within acceptable bounds.
   * **Integration Health Checks**: Regular assessments of integrated protocols to ensure operational stability.
2. **Emergency Response**:
   * **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Enables immediate suspension of protocol functions in critical situations.
   * **Emergency Shutdown Procedures**: Provides a swift response to high-risk incidents, protecting user funds.
   * **Fund Protection Mechanisms**: Protocol safeguards that protect assets during unexpected events.

   * **Time-Locked Operations**: Introduces delays for critical actions, providing a buffer for review.
   * **Multi-Signature Requirements**: Requires multiple approvals for sensitive operations to prevent unauthorized actions.
   * **Privilege Escalation Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to higher privilege levels.
   * **Activity Logging**: Maintains detailed logs of protocol interactions for auditing and accountability.
   * **Access Review Procedures**: Regular reviews of access permissions to maintain a secure environment.
2. **Upgrade Safety**:
   * **Transparent Proxy Patterns**: Enables secure, transparent upgrades without altering the core protocol.
   * **Time-Locked Upgrades**: Introduces a waiting period for upgrades, allowing time for review and rollback if needed.
   * **State Migration Protection**: Safeguards protocol states during upgrades, ensuring data integrity.
   * **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with previous protocol versions to prevent disruptions.
   * **Emergency Rollback Capability**: Provides the ability to revert to previous versions in case of unexpected issues.
   * **Version Control**: Comprehensive version tracking to monitor changes and ensure consistency.
