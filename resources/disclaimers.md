# ⚠️ Disclaimers

Amplified Protocol encourages all users to conduct their own due diligence and consult with professional advisors before making financial decisions.

### **Investment Risks**

1. **Smart Contract Risk**: Amplified Protocol operates on smart contracts, which, while rigorously tested and audited, may still contain vulnerabilities. Exploits or unforeseen issues could lead to a loss of funds.
2. **Market Volatility**: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. The value of digital assets can fluctuate significantly and without warning, impacting the value of your investments.
3. **Impermanent Loss**: Providing liquidity to LST pools may expose you to impermanent loss, a temporary reduction in value due to price divergence between assets in a liquidity pair. This risk is inherent to liquidity provision and should be carefully considered.

### **Responsibility & Due Diligence**

* **Personal Responsibility**: It is solely your responsibility to thoroughly research and understand the risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) and Amplified Protocol before participating.
* **Informed Decisions**: Amplified Protocol strongly advises users to evaluate their own risk tolerance and seek appropriate professional advice as necessary.

### **No Guarantees**

1. **Yield Fluctuations**: APY (Annual Percentage Yield) and APR (Annual Percentage Rate) are variable and can change based on market conditions, protocol performance, and other external factors. Historical returns are not indicative of future performance.
2. **Platform Risks**: While Amplified Protocol prioritizes security and undergoes regular audits, unforeseen technical issues, software bugs, or potential exploits may affect platform functionality and user funds.

### **Disclaimer Regarding Information Accuracy**

1. **Best Efforts**: While Amplified strives to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of information within this GitBook, the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape may render certain details outdated. Users should verify information with additional sources and stay informed of protocol updates.
2. **Not Financial Advice**: The information in this GitBook should not be considered a substitute for professional financial advice. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.

By using Amplified Protocol, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the disclaimers and associated risks outlined in this section. Your participation in Amplified Protocol is at your own risk, and Amplified assumes no liability for any potential losses.
