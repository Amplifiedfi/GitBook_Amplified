# Glossary

**LLT**: LLT (Liquidity Layer Token) is the governance token of Amplified Protocol, granting holders voting rights on protocol decisions and the ability to earn staking rewards. LLT holders play a key role in shaping the protocol's future through participation in governance.

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**: The annualized rate of return on an investment, factoring in the compounding of reinvested rewards over the year. APY reflects the potential earnings on an asset if reinvested continuously.

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: A financial system built on blockchain technology that operates without traditional intermediaries. DeFi enables permissionless access to financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and earning yields through decentralized protocols.

**ETH (Ethereum)**: The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, commonly used to pay transaction fees, deploy and interact with smart contracts, and participate in decentralized applications (dApps).

**LST (Liquid Staking Token)**: A tokenized representation of assets staked on Proof-of-Stake blockchains. LSTs allow holders to earn staking rewards while retaining liquidity, meaning they can be used in DeFi protocols without needing to unstake.

**Smart Contract**: A self-executing digital contract with terms written directly into code on a blockchain. Smart contracts automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement, enabling secure, trustless transactions without intermediaries.

**Super Vault**: Amplifiedâ€™s core smart contract responsible for managing user deposits, implementing LST strategies, and aggregating yields. The Super Vault simplifies user access to multiple DeFi strategies, enabling optimized yield generation within a single interface.

**Yield Farming**: A DeFi investment strategy where users maximize returns on their cryptocurrency holdings by lending, staking, or providing liquidity in various protocols. Yield farming involves actively managing assets to capture rewards from protocol incentives and yield-generating opportunities.
